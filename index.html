    <h1>Assignment 1</h1>
    <h2>A Recap of 08/29/2019</h2>
    <p>We went to github.com and created accounts under our nazareth email accounts. Next we created a repository, making sure to only name things with lowercase letters as it makes future coding atempts simpler. Then we went into the Terminal, where we changed the directory to our Desktop. We copied the url for the repository then typed git clone repository url which coppied the repository to our desktop. In Brackets, we added a new folder assignment1, we added a new file index.html the html being key, we copied the code from the CIStool doc and pasted it under the index.html file. Then we made a css folder and its corresponding styles.css file. </p>
    <p>We checked the git status which showed that we had 2 new files that were red  for not being added yet. after typing git add . it didn't appear to make a change, but when we typed git status once more, the two files were green. Then we stated git commit -m""and added a description between the parenthases. Typing git push only sent the code to the cloud so that others can view it from github. It made us log in but then we were all set.</p>
