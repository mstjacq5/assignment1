            <h1>Assignment 1</h1>
            <h2>A Recap of 08/29/2019</h2>
        
            <p><strong>We went to github.com and created accounts under our nazareth email address.</strong> Next we created a repository, making sure to only name things with lowercase letters as it makes future coding atempts simpler. <em>Then we went into the Terminal, where we changed the directory to our Desktop.</em> We copied the url for the repository then typed git clone repository url which coppied the repository to our desktop. In Brackets, we added a new folder assignment1, we added a new file index.html the html being key, we copied the code from the CIStool doc and pasted it under the index.html file. Then we made a css folder and its corresponding styles.css file. </p>
            <p><strong>We checked the git status which showed that we had 2 new files that were red for not being added yet.</strong> after typing git add . it didn't appear to make a change, but when we typed git status once more, the two files were green. Then we stated git commit -m""and added a description between the parenthases. Typing git push only sent the code to the cloud so that others can view it from github. <em>It made us log in but then we were all set.</em></p>
            <h2> A Recap of 9/3/2019</h2>
            <p>We learned about making things bold and itallics within the text of the paragraph. We learned <strong> that the command "strong" makes things bold, and although the command "b" would also work, it is not the recomended method.</strong> <em>We also learned that the "em" command turns text to itallics, and although the command "i" would also work, it is not the recommended method.</em> </p>
            <p> We learned about <sup>superscript</sup> and <sub>subscript</sub> they use the corresponding commands of "sup" and "sub"</p>
